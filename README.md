# Application Insights
Application Insights is a feature of Azure Monitor that provides extensible application performance management (APM) and monitoring for live web apps.
It can collect telemetry from your application like: logs, exceptions, requests and many other. 
The application is being monitored and telemetry data is sent to the Application Insights resource. All this telemetry data is integrated into Azure Monitor. After, you can use the Azure portal to apply analytics and tools to the raw data.
